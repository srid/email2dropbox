#+TITLE: Funnel

Funnel is an experiment in leveraging plain ol' filesystem for processing
network requests, such as email and webhooks, via Dropbox.

** Brainstorming

- Email to append-to-Dropbox
- Unix tools pipeped, processing on new content in Dropbox
- Possibly, tools write back to trigger remote actions (http request, email response, etc.)

** MVP 
- [ ] Create a Heroku app with a suitable /mail addon/.
- [ ] Use Dropbox app folder API
- [ ] Test by writing to hello.txt
