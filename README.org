#+TITLE: Funnel

Funnel is an experiment in leveraging plain ol' filesystem for processing
network requests, such as email and webhooks, via Dropbox. The *philosophy
behind funnel* is to facilitate the use of simple UNIX tools for processing data
that spans the network. As an *example*, the command =cat ${FILE} >>
org/Inbox.org= is all that is needed to process an incoming email (stored in
Dropbox) from the user requesting an addition of GTD inbox item to their org
file stored in Dropbox.

** Current design

- Email to Dropbox
- Unix tools pipeped, processing on new content in Dropbox
- Possibly, tools write back to trigger remote actions (http request, email response, etc.)
