#+TITLE: email2dropbox

Deploy this app to Heroku and get a free inbound email address to which you may
send emails which are then stored as timestamped JSON files in your Dropbox's
App folder.

* Getting started
- Deploy using app.json (automatically creates postmark and papertrail accounts)
  - Go to Dropbox, and create an app. Set app key and secret here.
- Take a note of $PASSWORD from heroku config
  - =export APPURL=https://user:${PASSWORD}@${APPNAME}.herokuapp.com=
- Set Dropbox's oauth redirect url to =${APPURL}/dropboxauth=
- Visit https://<thisapp>.herokuapp.com/ to complete oauth flow
  - Run the specified TOKEN cli
- =heroku addon:open postmark= and point the inbound URL to =${APPURL}/incoming=
- Send a test email to your postmark inbound address

** Processing JSON files

Here is a poller that appends to Inbox.org for each incoming message:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
  while true; do find . -name "*.json" -print0 | xargs -r -n 1 ~/Dropbox/org/toinbox.sh; sleep 2; done
#+END_SRC

The =toinbox.sh= script may look like:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
  #!/bin/bash
  set -e

  json=$1

  title() {
      jq -r .Subject $json
  }

  body() {
      # The `sed` removes \r
      jq -r .TextBody $json | sed ':a;N;$!ba;s/\r//g'
  }

  inboxfile=~/Dropbox/org/Inbox.org

  echo "** TODO `title`" >> $inboxfile
  body >> $inboxfile
  # echo >> $inboxfile  # ensure newline

  rm $json

#+END_SRC

* Tasks
** Current design

- Email to Dropbox
- Unix tools pipeped, processing on new content in Dropbox
- Possibly, tools write back to trigger remote actions (http request, email response, etc.)
